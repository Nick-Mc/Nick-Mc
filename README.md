- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nick-Mc
- ✈️ I’m interested in Aerospace
- 🖥️ I’m currently learning Aerospace Engineering
- 🚀 I'm currently working on Liquid Rocket Engine research and design project
- 🚀 I'm currently working on a Thrust Vector Control Device for small solid rocket engines
- 🤿⛵ ⛰️ I like to do anything in the outdoors like SCUBA diving, sailing, hiking, etc.

My name is Nicholas McCormick, and I'm an Aerospace Engineering Graduate from Iowa State University. I chose Aerospace Engineering at ISU because of its excellent reputation and the quality of the faculty and staff. I have a strong interest in aerodynamics, propulsion, and structural design. I have been passionate about space exploration and technology since a young age.

Outside of my studies, I am either outside, running, biking, boating, hiking, working on a personal project, or working on the PC I built, and I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and am excited to continue pursuing my professional goals after graduation.
